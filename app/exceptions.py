"""
Domain exceptions raised by the service layer.

These are plain Python exceptions with no FastAPI dependency, so services
can be unit-tested without spinning up the web framework at all. A single
set of exception handlers (registered in app/main.py) translates these
into the right HTTP status codes at the edge of the app.
